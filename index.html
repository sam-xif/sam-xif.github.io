                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    Born and raised in Andover, Massachusetts, I am the proud grandchild of Greek immigrants. By trade, I am a computer scientist and software engineer. My journey in computer science began at an early age, inspired by my father who works in software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I pursued my passion for computing at Northeastern University in Boston, where I completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science. During my graduate studies, I had the privilege of working on my master's thesis under the supervision of Dr. Pete Manolios.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most recently, I was part of the team at Paperless Parts, a Boston-based software startup revolutionizing the manufacturing industry with their innovative quoting software platform.
