                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    Born and raised in Andover, Massachusetts, I am the proud grandchild of Greek immigrants. By trade, I am a computer scientist and software engineer. My journey in computer science began at an early age, inspired by my father who works in software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                I pursued my passion for computer science at Northeastern University in Boston, where I completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science. During my graduate studies, I had the privilege of completing my master's thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/pete/">Dr. Pete Manolios</a>. My work focused on improving on pitfalls in current static analysis tooling in Python, such as frequent emission of false positives, by implementing <i>Type Hint Fuzzing</i>, a novel approach that uses fuzzing to check type annotations and discover bugs in Python code. 
                </p>
                <p>
                For the majority of my career in industry, I was part of the team at <a href="https://www.paperlessparts.com/">Paperless Parts</a>, a Boston-based software startup revolutionizing the manufacturing industry with their innovative quoting software platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                Recently, I joined <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> as a Software Engineer on the User Billing team, working on an extensible billing platform that will enable cross-functional business units to speak a shared language regarding how products are priced and how usage is billed.
